## Reflection Questions

1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here.
   [I only used the resources that were provided on the prework assignment site.]

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words)
   
   I think the only challenge I faced when submitting this assignment was completing the last guess function.
   I was having a bit of trouble with what to put in the if statements of "is turn over?" and "is this the last turn?"
   I wasnt to sure how to check through it, but just looked at the full code and remembered that I had the array pattern
   and manaeged to figure out what I was supposed to be iterating through. The only thing I didnt have,that the code had
   was the pattern.length -1. It was the function I spent most time on.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words)
   [I would love to know more about how to do the bonus features. I tried doing them but wasnt successful, Even though maybe all I needed was more time, Seeing how to do these extra features would have been lots of fun, 
   This is my first time doing something Like this and I really enjoyed it. I would also enjoy to know how to get this program to work on other devices like a phone or create it into an app.  ]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words)
   []
   I think I would have spent the rest of the hours working on implementing some bonus features. I was already getting started on them but began to realize that I was going to need much more time
   if I were to implement the bonus features.
